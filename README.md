# Capstone Project 2 - Interactive Static Website

This project is an upgraded version of the previous HTML-only capstone project, now enhanced with **CSS** for styling and **JavaScript** for interactivity. Completed as part of **The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela on Udemy, this project builds on foundational HTML skills, adding new visual and interactive features to create a more dynamic user experience.

## Project Overview

Capstone Project 2 is a static website created with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal was to evolve the basic HTML-only structure into a visually appealing, responsive, and interactive website. CSS is used to style and layout the content, while JavaScript adds basic interactivity for a more engaging user experience.

### Project Features

1. **Enhanced Layout and Styling**: CSS is applied to give the website a polished and responsive design, featuring a cohesive color scheme, typography, and layout.
2. **Interactivity with JavaScript**: Basic JavaScript functionality has been added, including interactive buttons, forms with validation, and a simple image carousel.
3. **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries ensure that the website looks good on various screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
4. **Improved Accessibility**: The project continues to focus on accessibility with `aria` attributes and descriptive links.

### Project Sections

The upgraded site includes the following sections:

- **Home Section**: Enhanced with background images and improved typography to create a welcoming first impression.
- **About Section**: Styled to present information in an attractive layout with images and text alignment.
- **Portfolio Section**: A responsive image gallery with a JavaScript-powered image carousel that allows users to scroll through project images.
- **Contact Section**: A contact form with basic JavaScript validation to ensure users enter valid information.
- **Footer**: An improved footer with links and contact information styled for readability and accessibility.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The underlying structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling for layout, colors, typography, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactive elements and basic form validation.

### Setup and Usage

### Future Improvements

With more time and resources, additional enhancements could include:

- Implementing advanced JavaScript functionality.
